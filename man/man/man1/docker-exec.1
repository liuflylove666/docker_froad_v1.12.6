CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Run a process in a running container.

.PP
The command started using \fB\fCdocker exec\fR will only run while the container's primary
process (\fB\fCPID 1\fR) is running, and will not be restarted if the container is restarted.

.PP
If the container is paused, then the \fB\fCdocker exec\fR command will wait until the
container is unpaused, and then run


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-detach\fP=\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP
   Detached mode: run command in the background. The default is \fIfalse\fP\&.

.PP
\fB\-\-detach\-keys\fP=""
  Override the key sequence for detaching a container. Format is a single character \fB\fC[a\-Z]\fR or \fB\fCctrl\-<value>\fR where \fB\fC<value>\fR is one of: \fB\fCa\-z\fR, \fB\fC@\fR, \fB\fC^\fR, \fB\fC[\fR, \fB\fC,\fR or \fB\fC\_\fR\&.

.PP

.PP

the same capabilities as the container, which may be limited. Set

.PP
The followings examples are all valid:
   \-\-user [user | user:group | uid | uid:gid | user:gid | uid:group ]

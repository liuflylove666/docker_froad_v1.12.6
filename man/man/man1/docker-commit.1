.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBdocker commit\fP
[\fB\-a\fP|\fB\-\-author\fP[=\fIAUTHOR\fP]]
[\fB\-c\fP|\fB\-\-change\fP[=[\fIDOCKERFILE INSTRUCTIONS\fP]]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Create a new image from an existing container specified by name or
container ID.  The new image will contain the contents of the
container filesystem, \fIexcluding\fP any data volumes. Refer to \fBdocker\-tag(1)\fP
for more information about valid image and tag names.

.PP
While the \fB\fCdocker commit\fR command is a convenient way of extending an
existing image, you should prefer the use of a Dockerfile and \fB\fCdocker
build\fR for generating images that you intend to share with other
people.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SH Creating a new image from an existing container
.PP
An existing Fedora based container has had Apache installed while running
in interactive mode with the bash shell. Apache is also running. To
create a new image run \fB\fCdocker ps\fR to find the container's ID and then run:

.PP
.RS

.nf
# docker commit \-m="Added Apache to Fedora base image" \\
  \-a="A D Ministrator" 98bd7fc99854 fedora/fedora\_httpd:20

.fi
.RE

.PP
Note that only a\-z0\-9\-\_. are allowed when naming images from an
existing container.

.SH Apply specified Dockerfile instructions while committing the image
.PP
If an existing container was created without the DEBUG environment
variable set to "true", you can create a new image based on that
container by first getting the container's ID with \fB\fCdocker ps\fR and
then running:

.PP
.RS

.nf
# docker commit \-c="ENV DEBUG true" 98bd7fc99854 debug\-image

.fi

.SH NAME
.PP
docker\-events \- Get real time events from the server


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBdocker events\fP
[\fB\-\-help\fP]
[\fB\-f\fP|\fB\-\-filter\fP[=\fI[]\fP]]
[\fB\-\-since\fP[=\fISINCE\fP]]
[\fB\-\-until\fP[=\fIUNTIL\fP]]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Get event information from the Docker daemon. Information can include historical
information and real\-time information.

.PP
Docker containers will report the following events:

.PP
.RS

.nf
attach, commit, copy, create, destroy, detach, die, exec\_create, exec\_detach, exec\_start, export, kill, oom, pause, rename, resize, restart, start, stop, top, unpause, update

.fi
.RE

.PP
Docker images report the following events:

.PP
.RS

.nf
delete, import, load, pull, push, save, tag, untag

.fi
.RE

.PP
Docker volumes report the following events:

.PP
.RS

.nf
create, mount, unmount, destroy

.fi
.RE

.PP
Docker networks report the following events:

.PP
.RS

.nf
create, connect, disconnect, destroy

.fi

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-\-help\fP
  Print usage statement

.PP
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-filter\fP=[]
   Provide filter values (i.e., 'event=stop')

.PP
\fB\-\-since\fP=""
   Show all events created since timestamp

.PP
\fB\-\-until\fP=""
   Stream events until this timestamp

.PP
The \fB\fC\-\-since\fR and \fB\fC\-\-until\fR parameters can be Unix timestamps, date formatted
timestamps, or Go duration strings (e.g. \fB\fC10m\fR, \fB\fC1h30m\fR) computed
relative to the client machine's time. If you do not provide the \fB\fC\-\-since\fR option,
the command returns only new and/or live events.  Supported formats for date
formatted time stamps include RFC3339Nano, RFC3339, \fB\fC2006\-01\-02T15:04:05\fR,
\fB\fC2006\-01\-02T15:04:05.999999999\fR, \fB\fC2006\-01\-02Z07:00\fR, and \fB\fC2006\-01\-02\fR\&. The local
timezone on the client will be used if you do not provide either a \fB\fCZ\fR or a
\fB\fC+\-00:00\fR timezone offset at the end of the timestamp.  When providing Unix
timestamps enter seconds[.nanoseconds], where seconds is the number of seconds
that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT), not counting leap
seconds (aka Unix epoch or Unix time), and the optional .nanoseconds field is a
fraction of a second no more than nine digits long.


.SH EXAMPLES
.SH Listening for Docker events
.PP
After running docker events a container 786d698004576 is started and stopped
(The container name has been shortened in the output below):

.PP
.RS

.nf
# docker events
2015\-01\-28T20:21:31.000000000\-08:00 59211849bc10: (from whenry/testimage:latest) start
2015\-01\-28T20:21:31.000000000\-08:00 59211849bc10: (from whenry/testimage:latest) die
2015\-01\-28T20:21:32.000000000\-08:00 59211849bc10: (from whenry/testimage:latest) stop

.fi
.RE

.SH Listening for events since a given date
.PP
Again the output container IDs have been shortened for the purposes of this document:

.PP
.RS

.nf
# docker events \-\-since '2015\-01\-28'
2015\-01\-28T20:25:38.000000000\-08:00 c21f6c22ba27: (from whenry/testimage:latest) create
2015\-01\-28T20:25:38.000000000\-08:00 c21f6c22ba27: (from whenry/testimage:latest) start
2015\-01\-28T20:25:39.000000000\-08:00 c21f6c22ba27: (from whenry/testimage:latest) create
2015\-01\-28T20:25:39.000000000\-08:00 c21f6c22ba27: (from whenry/testimage:latest) start
2015\-01\-28T20:25:40.000000000\-08:00 c21f6c22ba27: (from whenry/testimage:latest) die
2015\-01\-28T20:25:42.000000000\-08:00 c21f6c22ba27: (from whenry/testimage:latest) stop
2015\-01\-28T20:25:45.000000000\-08:00 c21f6c22ba27: (from whenry/testimage:latest) start
2015\-01\-28T20:25:45.000000000\-08:00 c21f6c22ba27: (from whenry/testimage:latest) die
2015\-01\-28T20:25:46.000000000\-08:00 c21f6c22ba27: (from whenry/testimage:latest) stop

.fi
.RE

.PP
The following example outputs all events that were generated in the last 3 minutes,
relative to the current time on the client machine:

.PP
.RS

.nf
# docker events \-\-since '3m'
2015\-05\-12T11:51:30.999999999Z07:00  4386fb97867d: (from ubuntu\-1:14.04) die
2015\-05\-12T15:52:12.999999999Z07:00  4386fb97867d: (from ubuntu\-1:14.04) stop
2015\-05\-12T15:53:45.999999999Z07:00  7805c1d35632: (from redis:2.8) die
2015\-05\-12T15:54:03.999999999Z07:00  7805c1d35632: (from redis:2.8) stop

.fi
.RE

.PP
If you do not provide the \-\-since option, the command returns only new and/or
live events.

docker\-volume \- Manage Docker volumes


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBdocker volume COMMAND\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBdocker volume\fP command has subcommands for managing data volumes. A data
volume is a specially\-designated directory that by\-passes storage driver
management.

.PP
Data volumes persist data independent of a container's life cycle. When you
delete a container, the Engine daemon does not delete any data volumes. You can
share volumes across multiple containers. Moreover, you can share data volumes
with other computing resources in your system.
